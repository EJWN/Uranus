        <h2>Angular</h2>
        <p>The page you're looking at was build using a framework we call Angular. Angular is a remarkable framework that empowers the creation of dynamic web applications through its component-based architecture</p>
        <p>By crafting reusable components that encompass HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, developers weave together the fabric of their applications. These components are organized into modules, each a cohesive unit of functionality.</p>
        <p>If we want to see how it all operates, we must first set up a development environment with Node.js and the Angular CLI, tools that simplify the process of project creation and deployment. In this way, Angular enables the construction of engaging and responsive applications, showcasing the harmony between technology and creativity.</p>
